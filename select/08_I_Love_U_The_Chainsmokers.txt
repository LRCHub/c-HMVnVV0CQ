In the Range outside and I'm thinkin' about loose ends
Even though we cut ties, I don't wanna be just friends
From the day I got your number, like Paris in the summer, it ends
Every day goes by, I wish I was in your bed
(Ooh) I love you, oh God
(Ooh) It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
(Ooh) I love you, oh my God
(Ooh) It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
(Ooh, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh) yeah, yeah
I love you, oh my God
You were on the west side, I was drivin' down the I-10
And the song came on, got me thinking who you chose instead
No, I never thought twice, but I wonder what you see in them
Another day goes by that I can't get you out of my head
(Ooh) I love you, oh God
(Ooh) It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
(Ooh) I love you, oh my God
(Ooh) It's hard to find a reason why we can't work this out
(Ooh, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh) yeah, yeah
(I love you)
When it ends, I'm convinced that you know it's not over
All my love's gonna fade, unless you're coming over
Do you think of my voice when your city gets colder?
