You know sometimes when you see yourself
You just see yourself, someone not good enough
And though there's times when you feel like
You can't do nothing right

And insecurity takes a hold
Obscures your vision of your soul
You can't see what's inside
Open up your eyes

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are

Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else
Until you love you

I know sometime its so hard to keep
Up your self esteem
Sometime you can feel so small
And it's so easy to tell yourself
You're not worth much at all

When you aren't sure of who you are
And now it's tearing you apart
You can't see what is true
Change your point of view

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are

Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else
Until you love you

Find what is real is what's inside you
Know there's no one else in this world like you
Take maybe just a little time to start and see
Just who you really are

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are

Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else
Until you love you

Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are

Learn to accept yourself
'Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else
Until you love

Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
I take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
You're beautiful
