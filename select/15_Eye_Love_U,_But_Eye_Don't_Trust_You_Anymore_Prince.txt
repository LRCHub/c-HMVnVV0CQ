I could tell from the moment you walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress you had on
That wasn't your perfume
And what happened to the ring that I gave you?
What am I to assume?

I love you, but I just don't trust you anymore

You could tell from the moment you looked in my eyes
That I could see right through you
You must apologize
I've always given you the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know you trust me, but you don't love me anymore
No

I love you, but I just don't trust you anymore

I remember meeting you here in the good ole' days
I would never pick the flower of my favorite protege
Maybe if I would have
Then you would not treat me this way
You tricked me - but you will not anymore

No, no, no, no

I love you, but I just don't trust you anymore
